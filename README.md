# Portfolio
This is my portfolio, a website with my skills and projects. Here you can find everything about me. The idea was create a beatiful and eficient website to people sees my projects and get more informations about it.

You can access the site in http://www.alissonrubim.com.

## Layout
The layout was made by me, on Photoshop CS6, in a saturday morning. My inspirations was the cards that the Google use on theirs website and foruns, the ideia was not copy the Google, but make something related to it.

On the top of the portifolio, has an dynamic particle system. This code it's from an third-part library, that you can find here: https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/ 


# What i have to do next
* I'm thinking in create a translation system for the site. The site is on Brazilian Portuguese. So, i'm thinking in make this in english too.
* Create a gallery. I love take pictures about things, and i thing that reveal what i'm and what i think about the world. So my ideia is put this on a gallery, so the people can see what i love.
* Create a learning area.
